      <h1 style="color:white">THE IRONMAN </h1>

      <p>The </p><header>Tony Stark is the wealthy son of industrialist and weapons manufacturer Howard Stark and his wife, Maria. Tony grew up a genius with a brilliant mind for technology and inventions and, naturally, followed in his father’s footsteps, inheriting Stark Industries upon his parents’ untimely death. Tony designed many weapons of war for Stark Industries, far beyond what any other company was creating, while living the lifestyle of a bon vivant.<p></p>

      <p>Since that first suit built in a cave, Tony has created dozens of new suits and upgrades over the years. However, throughout the 50-plus Iron Man models, there are common offensive and defense capabilities found in most iterations.</p>

      <p>The primary weapon contained within every suit, the repulsor rays use energy pulses to repel and disrupt enemies and are generated through the suit’s gauntlets. The suit’s booster jets enable Stark to fly fast enough to break the sound barrier, and maneuver more quickly than any fighter jet.</p>

      <h2 style="color:white">>ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF IRON MAM IN AVENGERS</h2>

      <p>The IRONMAN </p><article> In The Avengers, if Iron Man doesn’t intercept the nuclear missile headed for New York and redirect it into the Chitauri mothership not only is all of New York destroyed, but all of the Avengers on the ground with the possible exception of Hulk and Thor are killed as well. Plus, since the nuke hitting New York would not have defeated the Chitauri, earth would have ultimately fallen.<p></p>

      <p>In Avengers: Infinity War, had Tony not pursued Ebony Maw into space to save Doctor Strange, Strange would have certainly died pre-snap. Strange would then not have been on Titan to tell Tony that out of 14,000,605 possible outcomes the Avengers only prevail in one of them. And in case you forgot, that one winning outcome has Iron Man making the final snap, which is why Doctor Strange gave up the Time Stone to Thanos to keep him from killing Tony.<p></p>
